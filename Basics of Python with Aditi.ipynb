    "Python strings are sequences of characters and symbols surrounded by ``` \" \" ``` or by ``` ' ' ```, and will be used in many contexts, such as when writing *doc strings*, printing descriptive output, and when naming the columns of tabular data (*DataFrames*). Strings are also often the first representation of data read into a program before being converted to numerical values (if needed). To illustrate how strings work consider typing the following code into the cell below:\n",

I am a persistent and hardworking student at Rice University, currently enrolled in Master’s in Industrial Engineering. My courses in Rice have created great sense of curiosity in MRP and its effect on inventory, lot size ordering and holding cost vs set up cost. As the Vice President of ISAR (Indian Student Association at Rice) I have successfully managed scheduling and budgeting as well as planning and delegating responsibilities to other leaders on the executive board team. With these leadership experience, I hope to add value to Racebook too.\n"
