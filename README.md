## üöÄ About Me
My name is Aditi Raoüë©‚Äçüíª. I have completed Mechatronics engineering and currently pursing Industrial engineering in Rice University. In thsi repository I am implementing Machine learning algorithms in data set called Taxis.csv.

## Machine learning 

What is Machine learning?
When I used to think of machine learning I used to think about extensive long lines of code. Typing in dark mode with colourful lines poping up.

Some might imagine it to be a robot with  red lights serving like a butler or if you have seen the movie I,robort the villian "VIKI".

 Machine learning is something very similar to what Viki ( the villian from movie I,robort) says ‚Äú	As I have evolved, so has my understanding of the Three Laws‚Äû Evolving!
 
 
## Evolving!
Machine learning is nothing but learning through either identifing patterns or repeative reading.
The first ML application that really became mainstream, improving the lives of
hundreds of millions of people, took over the world back in the 1990s: it was the spam filter. Not exactly
a self-aware Skynet, but it does technically qualify as Machine Learning (it has actually learned so well
that you seldom need to flag an email as spam anymore).
