# Logistic Regression

Logistic Regression is a method used in mathematical and statictal applications 
It is a subcategory of supervised learning (when we have labeled data) in which we predict discrete values. Various algorithms that are available for classification are decision tree, k-nearest neighbor, logistic regression.

A logistic approach fits best when the task that the machine is learning is based on two values, or a binary classification.
Although, the dependent variable can be binary, multinomial, or ordinal
It is similar to Linear Regression, but it results in a more complex function, the sigmoid function.

You can observe how the value of **f(x)** changes when the value of x changes
