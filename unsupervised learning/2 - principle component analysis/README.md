 Principle Component Analysis is a dimension-reduciton tool that can be used to reduce a large set of variables into a smaller set that still contains the majority of the information from the larger set.

It transforms high-dimensions data into lower-dimensions while retaining as much information as possible.

To retain as much information as possible PCA needs to understand which part of our data is important and to do so, we mathematically quantify the amount of information embedded within the data using variance.

Greater the variance, the more the information.
